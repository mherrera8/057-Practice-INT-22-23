# 5.7 Practice - Compound Conditionals: Code Nation Social Club

You are creating a new Social Club exclusive for Code Nation students! But first, you must create a login form so only Code Nation students who know the username and password will be able to login...

## Code Along

1. Create a secret username and password and set them as the values of the variables on lines 2 and 3.

2. Inside the click handler create a compound conditional statement to check for the following:

* If the username **AND** password is correct, display a success message in the div with the class `message`.


## Code-it-Solo!

Create additional compound conditionals that check for the following:

3. If the username is correct AND the password is incorrect, display a "wrong password" message in the div with the class `message`.

4. If the password is correct AND the username is incorrect, display a "wrong username" message in the div with the class `message`.

5. Finally, if the password is incorrect OR the username is incorrect, display a "incorrect username and password" message in the div with the class `message`.

## BONUS CHALLENGE

6. If the username **OR** password fields are empty, display a message saying they should try entering something in the div with the class `message`. **Hint**: What string represents an "empty" message.
